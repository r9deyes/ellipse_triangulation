# ellipse_triangulation

The task is to find some "good" triangulation for ellipse with function {(x,y): Ax*x + 2*B*x*y + C*y*y <1, A*C - B*B > 0}
"Good" is coefficient for equality of all triangles, e.x. 0.7 ... 0.9
In this work I discribed own algorithm to find solution and show in Tkinter window.
